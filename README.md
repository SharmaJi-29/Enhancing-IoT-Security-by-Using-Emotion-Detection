## 📌 Overview

**IoT Security** is an AI-powered intelligent surveillance system designed to enhance traditional IoT security mechanisms using **facial emotion recognition** and **computer vision**.

Instead of relying only on motion detection, the system analyzes **human emotions** to identify suspicious or abnormal behavior in real time. This adds an intelligent behavioral layer to conventional IoT-based security systems.

This project is suitable for:
- Smart Homes
- Campuses
- Offices
- IoT-based surveillance infrastructures

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 Detect human faces in real time  
- 🧠 Recognize facial emotions using deep learning  
- 🔐 Enhance IoT security with behavioral awareness  
- 🖥️ Provide a GUI-based monitoring system  
- 🚀 Enable future alert and intrusion-prevention mechanisms
