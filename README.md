# Enhancing-IoT-Security-by-Using-Emotion-Detection
Enhancing IoT Security through Emotion Recognition and Intelligent Monitoring.

## 📌 Overview

IoT Security is an AI-powered intelligent surveillance system designed to enhance traditional IoT security mechanisms using facial emotion recognition and computer vision.
Instead of relying only on motion detection, the system analyzes human emotions to identify suspicious or abnormal behavior in real time.

This project is ideal for smart homes, campuses, offices, and IoT-based security infrastructures.

## 🎯 Objectives

•	🔍 Detect human faces in real-time
•	🧠 Recognize facial emotions using deep learning
•	🔐 Enhance IoT security with behavioral awareness
•	🖥️ Provide a GUI-based monitoring system
•	🚀 Enable future alert and intrusion-prevention mechanisms
